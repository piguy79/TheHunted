# TheHunted

## Story
You live on the outskirts of a desolated and oppresive empire.  Each district is ruled by force by local officers as well as a single, powerful overseer. You are no one. Only tired of seeing your friends, your family, be pulled away. The time has come for action, but your disobedience does not go unnoticed. The local overseer is responsible for quelling your rebellion, along with his minions. Time is limited. 

Go, now.

## 3 Pillars of gameplay to beat each level
1. Items - You must gather items to arm your character to prepare for the imminent overseer battle.  This can be through defeating smaller enemies, finding hidden loot, learning spells, etc.
2. Levelling - Leveling up to get better stats (attack, dodge, life, etc)
3. Knowledge - Each enemy has strengths and weaknesses.  Discover these to help you survive.

## Battles
1. Real-time on the map.  Tile-based movement
2. Perhaps is gesture based.  Left of screen moves, right side you draw attack/defense gestures
2. Combination of:
 1. Movement
 2. Opportunist attack/defense (think mike tyson's knockout), based on enemy patterns
