# TheHunted

## Story
You live on the outskirts of a desolated and oppresive empire.  Each district is ruled by force by local officers as well as a single, powerful overseer. You are no one. Through some event, you accidentally trigger a bit of magic, which is detected by the overseer.  He has started seeking the disturbance, and will find you. Time is limited. 

Go, now.

## Choice over randomness
Rather than a completely random build and leveling process, the user will be allowed to choose items, magic, and allocate character points from leveling.  However, some choices will be better than other based on the traits of the enemies and overseer.  For instance, if you find out that the overseer can turn invisible, you will need to use a reveal spell.

## 3 Pillars of gameplay to beat each level
1. Items - You must gather items to arm your character to prepare for the imminent overseer battle.  This can be through defeating smaller enemies, finding hidden loot, learning spells, etc.
2. Leveling - Leveling up to get better stats (attack, dodge, life, etc)
3. Knowledge - Each enemy has strengths and weaknesses.  Discover these to help you survive.  These are almost imperative to learn.

## Enemies

### Overseer
1. Each game gets a random overseer assigned to hunt you down:
 1. Finite number of designed overseers that has main set of attributes (3?)
 2. Secondary set of attributes that are randomly assigned, and picked from a larger pool.  These attributes could be spells or buffs that enhance the overseer?
 3. Overseer act quickly between actions, forcing you to respond much faster than in regular battles

## Spells
The user will need to find shrines to pray at in order to learn new spells.  Spells can be offensive and defensive.  Each spell will have an associated gesture to cast and have an appropriate counter.

## Offensive spells & Defensive Spells
1. Invisibility <-> Reveal spell (the default spell you start with)
2. Speed boost <-> Tangle or Slow spell
3. Burn <-> Chill
4. Electric <-> Discharge

## Battles
1. Real-time on the map.  Tile-based movement
2. Perhaps is gesture based.  Left of screen moves, right side you draw attack/defense gestures
2. Combination of:
 1. Movement
 2. Opportunist attack/defense (think mike tyson's knockout), based on enemy patterns. Also zelda, where bosses fight in stages that unfold
